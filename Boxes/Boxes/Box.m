//Add a method that takes in another box and returns how many times one box will fit inside the other. Be conscious about understanding which box has a greater volume and how that will affect the result.
//NOTE: Just use the volumes to calculate how many times a box can fit into another box, don't bother with trying to come up with the logic of physically fitting boxes into each other.
